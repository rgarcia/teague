The project uses pnpm as the package manager.

If adding any npm packages, never edit the package.json directly. Use `pnpm install` instead of `npm install`.  If adding a @types/* package, make sure to use `pnpm install -D` to add it to dev dependencies.

Be careful to run `pnpm install` in the correct directory so that you are adding the dependency to the correct sub package. We have packages in packages/* and source code is usually in packages/*/src/*.

If running a script in package.json, change to the directory of the package.json file and run `pnpm run <script name>`.

If running a one-off script you can just do `pnpx tsx <path to script>`.
