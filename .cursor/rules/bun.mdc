The project uses Bun as the runtime.

If adding any npm packages, never edit the package.json directly. Use `bun install` instead of `npm install`. 

Be careful to run `bun install` in the correct directory so that you are adding the dependency to the correct sub package. We have packages in packages/* and source code is usually in packages/*/src/*.

If running a script in package.json, change to the directory of the package.json file and run `bun run <script name>`.

If running a one-off script you can just do `bun <path to script>`.
